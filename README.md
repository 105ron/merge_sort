#Merge Sort

Merge Sort, a type of sort that lends itself well to recursion and can be much faster than bubble sort on the right data sets. The `#merge_sort` method takes an array and sorts it using a using the the recursive merge sort algorithm from smallest to largest.

To get a better idea of how merge sort works, watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAsokGNa18k) and [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNhpFO9CmPs) for an explanation.
